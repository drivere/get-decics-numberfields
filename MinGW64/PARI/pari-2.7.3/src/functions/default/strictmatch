Help:
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on, unused characters after a
 sequence has been
 processed will produce an error. Otherwise just a warning is printed. This
 can be useful when you are unsure how many parentheses you have to close
 after complicated nested loops. Please do not use this; find a decent
 text-editor instead.

 The default value is \kbd{1}.
