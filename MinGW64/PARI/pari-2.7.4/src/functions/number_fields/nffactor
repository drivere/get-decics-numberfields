Help: nffactor(nf,T): factor polynomial T in number field nf.
Doc: factorization of the univariate
 polynomial $T$ over the number field $\var{nf}$ given by \kbd{nfinit}; $T$
 has coefficients in $\var{nf}$ (i.e.~either scalar, polmod, polynomial or
 column vector). The factors are sorted by increasing degree.

 The main variable of $\var{nf}$ must be of \emph{lower}
 priority than that of $T$, see \secref{se:priority}. However if
 the polynomial defining the number field occurs explicitly  in the
 coefficients of $T$ as modulus of a \typ{POLMOD} or as a \typ{POL}
 coefficient, its main variable must be \emph{the same} as the main variable
 of $T$. For example,
 \bprog
 ? nf = nfinit(y^2 + 1);
 ? nffactor(nf, x^2 + y); \\@com OK
 ? nffactor(nf, x^2 + Mod(y, y^2+1)); \\ @com OK
 ? nffactor(nf, x^2 + Mod(z, z^2+1)); \\ @com WRONG
 @eprog

 It is possible to input a defining polynomial for \var{nf}
 instead, but this is in general less efficient since parts of an \kbd{nf}
 structure will then be computed internally. This is useful in two
 situations: when you do not need the \kbd{nf} elsewhere, or when you cannot
 compute the field discriminant due to integer factorization difficulties. In
 the latter case, if you must use a partial discriminant factorization (as
 allowed by both \tet{nfdisc} or \tet{nfbasis}) to build a partially correct
 \var{nf} structure, always input \kbd{nf.pol} to \kbd{nffactor}, and not your
 makeshift \var{nf}: otherwise factors could be missed.
