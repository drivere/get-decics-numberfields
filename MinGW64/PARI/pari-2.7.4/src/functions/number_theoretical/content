Doc: computes the gcd of all the coefficients of $x$,
 when this gcd makes sense. This is the natural definition
 if $x$ is a polynomial (and by extension a power series) or a
 vector/matrix. This is in general a weaker notion than the \emph{ideal}
 generated by the coefficients:
 \bprog
 ? content(2*x+y)
 %1 = 1            \\ = gcd(2,y) over Q[y]
 @eprog

 If $x$ is a scalar, this simply returns the absolute value of $x$ if $x$ is
 rational (\typ{INT} or \typ{FRAC}), and either $1$ (inexact input) or $x$
 (exact input) otherwise; the result should be identical to \kbd{gcd(x, 0)}.

 The content of a rational function is the ratio of the contents of the
 numerator and the denominator. In recursive structures, if a
 matrix or vector \emph{coefficient} $x$ appears, the gcd is taken
 not with $x$, but with its content:
 \bprog
 ? content([ [2], 4*matid(3) ])
 %1 = 2
