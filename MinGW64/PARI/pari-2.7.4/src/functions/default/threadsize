Doc: In parallel mode, each thread needs its own private \tev{stack} in which
 to do its computations, see \kbd{parisize}. This value determines the size
 in bytes of the stacks of each thread, so the total memory allocated will be
 $\kbd{parisize}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsize}$.

 If set to $0$, the value used is the same as \kbd{parisize}.

 The default value is $0$.
