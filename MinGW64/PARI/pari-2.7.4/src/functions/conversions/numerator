 numerator of $x$. The meaning of this
 is clear when $x$ is a rational number or function. If $x$ is an integer
 or a polynomial, it is treated as a rational number or function,
 respectively, and the result is $x$ itself. For polynomials, you
 probably want to use
 \bprog
 numerator( content(x) )
 @eprog\noindent
 instead.

 In other cases, \kbd{numerator(x)} is defined to be
 \kbd{denominator(x)*x}. This is the case when $x$ is a vector or a
 matrix, but also for \typ{COMPLEX} or \typ{QUAD}. In particular since a
 \typ{PADIC} or \typ{INTMOD} has  denominator $1$, its numerator is
 itself.

 \misctitle{Warning} Multivariate objects are created according to variable
 priorities, with possibly surprising side effects ($x/y$ is a polynomial, but
 $y/x$ is a rational function). See \secref{se:priority}.
