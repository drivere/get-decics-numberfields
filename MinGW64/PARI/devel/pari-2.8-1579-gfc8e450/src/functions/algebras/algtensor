C-Name: algtensor
Prototype: GGD1,L,
Help: algtensor(al1,al2,{maxord=1}): tensor product of al1 and al2.
Doc: Given two algebras \var{al1} and \var{al2}, computes their tensor
 product. For table algebras output by \tet{algtableinit}, the flag
 \var{maxord} is ignored. For central simple algebras output by \tet{alginit},
 computes a maximal order by default. Prevent this computation by setting
 $\var{maxord}=0$.

 Currently only implemented for cyclic algebras of coprime degree over the same
 center~$K$, and the tensor product is over~$K$.
