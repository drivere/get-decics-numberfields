Help: bernvec(x): Vector of rational Bernoulli numbers B_0, B_2,...up to
 B_(2x).
Doc: creates a vector containing, as rational numbers,
 the \idx{Bernoulli numbers} $B_0$, $B_2$,\dots, $B_{2x}$.
 This routine is obsolete. Use \kbd{bernfrac} instead each time you need a
 Bernoulli number in exact form.

 \misctitle{Note} This routine is implemented using repeated independent
 calls to \kbd{bernfrac}, which is faster than the standard recursion in exact
 arithmetic. It is only kept for backward compatibility: it is not faster than
 individual calls to \kbd{bernfrac}, its output uses a lot of memory space,
 and coping with the index shift is awkward.
