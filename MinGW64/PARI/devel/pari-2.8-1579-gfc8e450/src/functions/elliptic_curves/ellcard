Function: ellcard
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellcard
Prototype: GDG
Help: ellcard(E,{p}): computes the order of the group E(Fp)
 for the elliptic curve E, defined over Q or a finite field.
Doc: Let $E$ be an \var{ell} structure as output by \kbd{ellinit}, defined over
 $\Q$ or a finite field $\F_q$. The argument $p$ is best left omitted if the
 curve is defined over a finite field, and must be a prime number otherwise.
 This function computes the order of the group $E(\F_q)$ (as would be
 computed by \tet{ellgroup}).

 If the curve is defined over $\Q$, $p$ must be explicitly given and the
 function computes the cardinality of the reduction over $\F_p$; the
 equation need not be minimal at $p$, but a minimal model will be more
 efficient. The reduction is allowed to be singular, and we return the order
 of the group of non-singular points in this case.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellcard}{GEN E, GEN p} where $p$ is not
 \kbd{NULL}.
