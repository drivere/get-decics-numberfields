Function: ellpadicheightmatrix
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellpadicheightmatrix
Prototype: GGLG
Help: ellpadicheightmatrix(E,p,n,v): gives the height-pairing matrix for vector
 of points v on elliptic curve E.
Doc: $v$ being a vector of points, this function outputs the Gram matrix of
 $v$ with respect to the cyclotomic $p$-adic height, given to $n$ $p$-adic
 digits; in other words, the $(i,j)$ component of the matrix is equal to
 \kbd{ellpadicheight}$(E,p,n, v[i],v[j]) = [f,g]$.

 See \tet{ellpadicheight}; in particular one can replace the parameter $p$
 prime by a vector $[p,[a,b]]$, in which case the routine returns the matrix
 containing the $p$-adic numbers $af + bg$.
