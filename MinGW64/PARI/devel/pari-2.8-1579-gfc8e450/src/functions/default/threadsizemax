Doc: In parallel mode, each threads needs its own private \tev{stack} in which
 to do its computations, see \kbd{parisize}. This value determines the maximal
 size in bytes of the stacks of each thread, so the total memory allocated will
 be between $\kbd{parisize}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsize}$. and
 $\kbd{parisize}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsizemax}$.

 If set to $0$, the value used is the same as \kbd{threadsize}.

 The default value is $0$.
