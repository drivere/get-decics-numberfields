Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI library, needs a
 \tev{stack} in which to do its computations.  If non-zero,  \kbd{parisizemax}
 is the maximum size the stack can grow to, in bytes.  If zero, the stack will
 not automatically grow, and will be limited to the value of \kbd{parisize}.

 We strongly recommend to set \tet{parisizemax} to a non-zero value, about
 what you believe your machine can stand: PARI will then try to fit its
 computations within about \kbd{parisize} bytes, but will increase the stack
 size if needed (up to \kbd{parisizemax}). Once the memory intensive
 computation is over, PARI will restore the stack size to the originally
 requested \kbd{parisize}.

 The default value is $0$.
