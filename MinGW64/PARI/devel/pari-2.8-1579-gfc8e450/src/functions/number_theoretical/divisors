Prototype: G
Help: divisors(x): gives a vector formed by the divisors of x in increasing
 order.
Description:
 (gen):vec        divisors($1)
Doc: creates a row vector whose components are the
 divisors of $x$. The factorization of $x$ (as output by \tet{factor}) can
 be used instead.

 By definition, these divisors are the products of the irreducible
 factors of $n$, as produced by \kbd{factor(n)}, raised to appropriate
 powers (no negative exponent may occur in the factorization). If $n$ is
 an integer, they are the positive divisors, in increasing order.
