Help: ellgenerators(E): If E is an elliptic curve over the rationals,
 return the generators of the Mordell-Weil group associated to the curve.
 This relies on the curve being referenced in the elldata database.
 If E is an elliptic curve over a finite field Fq as output by ellinit(),
 return a minimal set of generators for the group E(Fq).
Doc:
 If $E$ is an elliptic curve over the rationals, return a $\Z$-basis of the
 free part of the \idx{Mordell-Weil group} associated to $E$.  This relies on
 the \tet{elldata} database being installed and referencing the curve, and so
 is only available for curves over $\Z$ of small conductors.
 If $E$ is an elliptic curve over a finite field $\F_q$ as output by
 \tet{ellinit}, return a minimal set of generators for the group $E(\F_q)$.
