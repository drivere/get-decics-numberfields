Help: factorcantor(x,p): factorization mod p of the polynomial x using
 Cantor-Zassenhaus.
Doc: factors the polynomial $x$ modulo the
 prime $p$, using distinct degree plus
 \idx{Cantor-Zassenhaus}\sidx{Zassenhaus}. The coefficients of $x$ must be
 operation-compatible with $\Z/p\Z$. The result is a two-column matrix, the
 first column being the irreducible polynomials dividing $x$, and the second
 the exponents. If you want only the \emph{degrees} of the irreducible
 polynomials (for example for computing an $L$-function), use
 $\kbd{factormod}(x,p,1)$. Note that the \kbd{factormod} algorithm is
 usually faster than \kbd{factorcantor}.
