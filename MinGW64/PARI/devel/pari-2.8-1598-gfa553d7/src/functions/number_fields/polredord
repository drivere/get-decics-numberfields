Function: polredord
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polredord
Prototype: G
Help: polredord(x): reduction of the polynomial x, staying in the same order.
Doc: finds polynomials with reasonably small
 coefficients and of the same degree as that of $x$ defining suborders of the
 order defined by $x$. One of the polynomials always defines $\Q$ (hence
 is equal to $(x-1)^n$, where $n$ is the degree), and another always defines
 the same order as $x$ if $x$ is irreducible. Useless function: try
 \kbd{polredbest}.
