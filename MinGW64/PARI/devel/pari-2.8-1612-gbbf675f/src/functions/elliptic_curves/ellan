Function: ellan
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: anell
Prototype: GL
Help: ellan(E,n): computes the first n Fourier coefficients of the
 L-function of the elliptic curve E (n<2^24 on a 32-bit machine).
Doc: computes the vector of the first $n$ Fourier coefficients $a_k$
 corresponding to the elliptic curve $E$. The curve must be given by an
 integral model, not necessarily minimal, although a minimal model will make
 the function faster.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{anellsmall}{GEN e, long n}, which
 returns a \typ{VECSMALL} instead of a \typ{VEC}, saving on memory.
