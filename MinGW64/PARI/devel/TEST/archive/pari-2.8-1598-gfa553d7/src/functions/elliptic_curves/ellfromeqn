Help: ellfromeqn(P): Given a genus 1 plane curve, defined by the affine
 equation f(x,y) = 0, return the coefficients [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] of a
 Weierstrass equation for its Jacobian.
 This allows to recover a Weierstrass model for an elliptic curve given by a
 general plane cubic or by a binary quartic or biquadratic model.

 Given a genus $1$ plane curve, defined by the affine equation $f(x,y) = 0$,
 return the coefficients $[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6]$ of a Weierstrass equation
 for its Jacobian. This allows to recover a Weierstrass model for an elliptic
 curve given by a general plane cubic or by a binary quartic or biquadratic
 model.

 The function implements the $f \mapsto f^*$ formulae of Artin, Tate and
 Villegas (Advances in Math. 198 (2005), pp. 366--382).

 In the example below, the function is used to convert between twisted Edward
 coordinates and Weierstrass coordinates.

 \bprog
 ? e = ellfromeqn(a*x^2+y^2-(1+d*x^2*y^2))
 %1 = [0,-a-d,0,-4*d*a,4*d*a^2+4*d^2*a]
 ? E = ellinit(ellfromeqn(y^2-x^2 - 1 +(121665/121666*x^2*y^2)),2^255-19);
 ? ellcard(E)
 %2 = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926856930875039260848015607506283634007912

 The elliptic curve associated to the sum of two cubes is given by
 \bprog
 ? ellfromeqn(x^3+y^3-a)
 %1 = [0,0,-9*a,0,-27*a^2]
 @eprog

 Congruent number problem: Let $n$ be an integer,
 if $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $a\*b=2\*n$,
 then by substituting $b$ by $2\*n/a$ in the first equation,
 we get $((a^2+(2\*n/a)^2)-c^2)*a^2 = 0$.
 We set $x=a$, $y=a*c$.
 \bprog
 ? ellfromeqn((x^2+(2*n/x)^2-(y/x)^2)*x^2)
 %1 = [0,0,0,-16*n^2,0]
 @eprog
 For example $23$ is congruent since the curve has a point of infinite order,
 namely:
 \bprog
 ? ellheegner(ellinit(subst([0,0,0,-16*n^2,0],n,23)))
 %2 = [168100/289,68053440/4913]
