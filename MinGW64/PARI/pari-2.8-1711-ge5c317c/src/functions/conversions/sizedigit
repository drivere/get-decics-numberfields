Help: sizedigit(x): rough upper bound for the number of decimal digits
 of (the components of) $x$. DEPRECATED.
Doc:
 outputs a quick upper bound for the number of decimal digits of (the
 components of) $x$, off by at most $1$. More precisely, for a positive
 integer $x$, it computes (approximately) the ceiling of
 $$\kbd{floor}(1 + \log_2 x) \log_{10}2,$$

 This function is DEPRECATED, essentially meaningless, and provided for
 backwards compatibility only. Don't use it!

 To count the number of decimal digits of a positive integer $x$, use
 \kbd{\#digits(x)}. To estimate (recursively) the size of $x$, use
 \kbd{normlp(x)}.
