Help: rnfidealabstorel(rnf,x): transforms the ideal x from absolute to
 relative representation.
Doc: let $\var{rnf}$ be a relative
 number field extension $L/K$ as output by \kbd{rnfinit} and $x$ be an ideal of
 the absolute extension $L/\Q$ given by a $\Z$-basis of elements of $L$.
 Returns the relative pseudo-matrix in HNF giving the ideal $x$ considered as
 an ideal of the relative extension $L/K$, i.e.~as a $\Z_K$-module.

 The reason why the input does not use the customary HNF in terms of a fixed
 $\Z$-basis for $\Z_L$ is precisely that no such basis has been explicitly
 specified. On the other hand, if you already computed an (absolute) \var{nf}
 structure \kbd{Labs} associated to $L$, and $m$ is in HNF, defining
 an (absolute) ideal with respect to the $\Z$-basis \kbd{Labs.zk}, then
 \kbd{Labs.zk * m} is a suitable $\Z$-basis for the ideal, and
 \bprog
   rnfidealabstorel(rnf, Labs.zk * m)
 @eprog\noindent converts $m$ to a relative ideal.
 \bprog
 ? K = nfinit(y^2+1); L = rnfinit(K, x^2-y); Labs = nfinit(L);
 ? m = idealhnf(Labs, 17, x^3+2);
 ? B = rnfidealabstorel(L, Labs.zk * m)

 ? A = rnfidealreltoabs(L, B)
 %4 = [17, x^2 + 4, x + 8, x^3 + 8*x^2]   \\ Z-basis for m in Q[x]/(L.pol)
