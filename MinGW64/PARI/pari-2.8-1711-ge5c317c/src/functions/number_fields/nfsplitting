Help: nfsplitting(nf,{d}): defining polynomial for the splitting field of
 the number field nf; if d is given, it must be the degree of the splitting
 field
Doc: defining polynomial for the splitting field of \var{nf};
 if $d$ is given, it must be the degree of the splitting field. It
 is possible to input a defining polynomial $T$ instead but this is in
 general less efficient.
 \bprog
 ? K = nfinit(x^3-2);
 ? nfsplitting(K)
 %2 = x^6 + 108
 ?  nfsplitting(x^8-2)
 %3 = x^16 + 272*x^8 + 64
 @eprog\noindent
 The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the degree $d$ of the
 splitting field and the bitsize of $T$; if $d$ is large the result will
 likely be unusable, e.g. \kbd{nfinit} will not be an option:
 \bprog
 ? nfsplitting(x^6-x-1)
 [... degree 720 polynomial deleted ...]
