J. E. Cremona Elliptic Curve Data for PARI/GP
=============================================

This is the PARI/GP version of J. E. Cremona Elliptic Curve Data
<http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/INDEX.html>

This package contains elliptic curves defined over the rationals representing
all isogeny classes for all conductor less than 350000. Theses data are needed
by ellsearch, ellidentify and ellgenerators and require PARI/GP 2.2.11 and up.

Note that the numbering of curves inside isogeny classes follows the update
from 11/04/2012.

See <http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html> for other PARI/GP packages.
