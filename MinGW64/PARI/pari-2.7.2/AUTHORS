The PARI/GP project started around 1985 in the Laboratoire A2X (Universite
Bordeaux 1, France)  and a first version was written by  Christian  Batut,
Dominique Bernardi, Henri Cohen and Michel Olivier and maintained by Henri
Cohen till 1995. Karim Belabas took over the maintainance between 1995 and
2001,  the project has been jointly maintained by Bill Allombert and Karim
Belabas since 2002.

A great  number  of people  have contributed  code through  the successive
stages which eventually resulted in the present version  of PARI/GP.  Even
more people, too numerous to list, contributed by testing,  reporting bugs
or suggesting improvements, Igor Schein foremost among them.

We would like to thank them all here.

Current lead developers:

  Bill ALLOMBERT (Bordeaux)
  Karim BELABAS (Bordeaux)
