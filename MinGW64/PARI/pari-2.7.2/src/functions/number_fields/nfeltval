Help: nfeltval(nf,x,pr): valuation of element x at the prime pr as output by
 idealprimedec.
Doc: given an element $x$ in
 \var{nf} and a prime ideal \var{pr} in the format output by
 \kbd{idealprimedec}, computes the valuation at \var{pr} of the
 element $x$. The same result can be obtained using
 \kbd{idealval(\var{nf},x,\var{pr})}, since $x$ is then converted to a
 principal ideal.
