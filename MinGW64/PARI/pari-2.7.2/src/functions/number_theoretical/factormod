Function: factormod
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: factormod0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: factormod(x,p,{flag=0}): factors the polynomial x modulo the prime p, using Berlekamp. flag is optional, and can be 0: default or 1:
 only the degrees of the irreducible factors are given.
Doc: factors the polynomial $x$ modulo the prime integer $p$, using
 \idx{Berlekamp}. The coefficients of $x$ must be operation-compatible with
 $\Z/p\Z$. The result is a two-column matrix, the first column being the
 irreducible polynomials dividing $x$, and the second the exponents. If $\fl$
 is non-zero, outputs only the \emph{degrees} of the irreducible polynomials
 (for example, for computing an $L$-function). A different algorithm for
 computing the mod $p$ factorization is \kbd{factorcantor} which is sometimes
 faster.
