Help: direuler(p=a,b,expr,{c}): Dirichlet Euler product of expression expr
 from p=a to p=b, limited to b terms. Expr should be a polynomial or rational
 function in p and X, and X is understood to mean p^(-s). If c is present,
 output only the first c terms.
Wrapper: (,,G)
Description:
  (gen,gen,closure,?gen):gen direuler(${3 cookie}, ${3 wrapper}, $1, $2, $4)
Doc: computes the \idx{Dirichlet series} associated to the
 \idx{Euler product} of expression \var{expr} as $p$ ranges through the primes
 from $a$
 to $b$. \var{expr} must be a polynomial or rational function in another
 variable than $p$ (say $X$) and $\var{expr}(X)$ is understood as the local
 factor $\var{expr}(p^{-s})$.

 The series is output as a vector of coefficients. If $c$ is present, output
 only the first $c$ coefficients in the series. The following command computes
 the \teb{sigma} function, associated to $\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)$:
 \bprog
