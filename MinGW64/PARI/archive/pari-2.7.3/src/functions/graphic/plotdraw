C-Name: rectdraw_flag
Prototype: vGD0,L,
Help: plotdraw(list, {flag=0}): draw vector of rectwindows list at indicated
 x,y positions; list is a vector w1,x1,y1,w2,x2,y2,etc. If flag!=0, x1, y1
 etc. express fractions of the size of the current output device.
Doc: physically draw the rectwindows given in $list$
 which must be a vector whose number of components is divisible by 3. If
 $list=[w1,x1,y1,w2,x2,y2,\dots]$, the windows $w1$, $w2$, etc.~are
 physically placed with their upper left corner at physical position
 $(x1,y1)$, $(x2,y2)$,\dots\ respectively, and are then drawn together.
 Overlapping regions will thus be drawn twice, and the windows are considered
 transparent. Then display the whole drawing in a special window on your
 screen. If $\fl \neq 0$, x1, y1 etc. express fractions of the size of the
 current output device
