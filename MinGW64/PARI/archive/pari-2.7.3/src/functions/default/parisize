Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI
 library, needs a \tev{stack} in which to do its computations. \kbd{parisize}
 is the stack size, in bytes. It is strongly recommended you increase this
 default (using the \kbd{-s} command-line switch, or a \tet{gprc}) if you can
 afford it. Don't increase it beyond the actual amount of RAM installed on
 your computer or \kbd{gp} will spend most of its time paging.

 In case of emergency, you can use the \tet{allocatemem} function to
 increase \kbd{parisize}, once the session is started.

 The default value is 4M, resp.~8M on a 32-bit, resp.~64-bit machine.
