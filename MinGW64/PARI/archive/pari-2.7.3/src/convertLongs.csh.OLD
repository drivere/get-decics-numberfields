# The trick is to do the replace without affecting other words that contain the text "long", such as ulong.
# This can be done with 5 separate replaces:
# 1.) " long"
# 2.) "(long"
# 3.) "{long"
# 4.) ",long"
# 5.) long is the first word on the line
# This will also replace long* with pari_long*, but this is what we want.

# The above changes longjmp to pari_longjmp.  So change it back. Overwrite the original file with the result.
