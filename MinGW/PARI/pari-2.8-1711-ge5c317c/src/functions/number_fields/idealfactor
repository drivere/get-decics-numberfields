Function: idealfactor
Section: number_fields
C-Name: idealfactor
Prototype: GG
Help: idealfactor(nf,x): factorization of the ideal x given in HNF into
 prime ideals in the number field nf.
Doc: factors into prime ideal powers the
 ideal $x$ in the number field $\var{nf}$. The output format is similar to the
 \kbd{factor} function, and the prime ideals are represented in the form
 output by the \kbd{idealprimedec} function, i.e.~as 5-element vectors.
