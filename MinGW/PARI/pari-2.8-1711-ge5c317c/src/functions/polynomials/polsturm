Help: polsturm(T,{ab}): number of real roots of the squarefree polynomial
 T (in the interval ab = [a,b] if present).
Doc: number of real roots of the real squarefree polynomial \var{T}. If
 the argument \var{ab} is present, it must be a vector $[a,b]$ with
 two real components (of type \typ{INT}, \typ{REAL}, \typ{FRAC}
 or  \typ{INFINITY}) and we count roots belonging to that closed interval.

 If possible, you should stick to exact inputs, that is avoid \typ{REAL}s in
 $T$ and the bounds $a,b$: the result is then guaranteed and we use a fast
 algorithm (Uspensky's method, relying on Descartes's rule of sign, see
 \tet{polrootsreal}); otherwise, we use Sturm's algorithm and the result
 may be wrong due to round-off errors.
 \bprog
 ? T = (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3);
 ? polsturm(T)
 %2 = 3
 ? polsturm(T, [-oo,2])
 %3 = 2
 ? polsturm(T, [1/2,+oo])
 %4 = 3
 ? polsturm(T, [1, Pi])  \\ Pi inexact: not recommended !
 %5 = 3

 The library syntax is \fun{long}{RgX_sturmpart}{GEN T, GEN ab} or
 \fun{long}{sturm}{GEN T} (for the case \kbd{ab = NULL}). The function
 \fun{long}{sturmpart}{GEN T, GEN a, GEN b} is obsolete and deprecated.
