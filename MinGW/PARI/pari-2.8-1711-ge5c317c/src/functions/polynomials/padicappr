C-Name: padicappr
Prototype: GG
Help: padicappr(pol,a): p-adic roots of the polynomial pol congruent to a mod p.
Doc: vector of $p$-adic roots of the
 polynomial $pol$ congruent to the $p$-adic number $a$ modulo $p$, and with
 the same $p$-adic precision as $a$. The number $a$ can be an ordinary
 $p$-adic number (type \typ{PADIC}, i.e.~an element of $\Z_p$) or can be an
 integral element of a finite extension of $\Q_p$, given as a \typ{POLMOD}
 at least one of whose coefficients is a \typ{PADIC}. In this case, the result
 is the vector of roots belonging to the same extension of $\Q_p$ as $a$.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{Zp_appr}{GEN f, GEN a} when $a$ is a
 \typ{PADIC}.
