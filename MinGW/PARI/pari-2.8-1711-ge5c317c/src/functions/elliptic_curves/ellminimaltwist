Function: ellminimaltwist
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellminimaltwist0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: ellminimaltwist(E, {flag=0}): E being an elliptic curve defined over Q, return
 a discriminant D such the twist of E by D is minimal among all possible quadratic
 twists, i.e.  if flag=0, its minimal model has minimal discriminant,
 or if flag=1, it has minimal conductor.
Doc: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\Q$, return
 a discriminant $D$ such that the twist of $E$ by $D$ is minimal among all
 possible quadratic twists, i.e. if $\fl=0$, its minimal model has minimal
 discriminant, or if $\fl=1$, it has minimal conductor.
Variant: Also available are
 \fun{GEN}{ellminimaltwist}{E} for $\fl=0$, and
 \fun{GEN}{ellminimaltwistcond}{E} for $\fl=1$.
