Function: setrand
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: setrand
Prototype: vG
Help: setrand(n): reset the seed of the random number generator to n.
Doc: reseeds the random number generator using the seed $n$. No value is
 returned. The seed is either a technical array output by \kbd{getrand}, or a
 small positive integer, used to generate deterministically a suitable state
 array. For instance, running a randomized computation starting by
 \kbd{setrand(1)} twice will generate the exact same output.
