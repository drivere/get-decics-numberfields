Function: parforprime
Section: programming/parallel
C-Name: parforprime0
Prototype: vV=GDGJDVDI
Description:
 (gen,gen,closure):void parforprime($1, $2, $3, NULL, NULL)
Help: parforprime(p=a,{b},expr1,{j},{expr2}): evaluates the sequence expr2
 (dependent on p and j) for p prime between a and b, in random order,
 computed in parallel. Substitute for j the value of expr1 (dependent on p).
 If b is omitted, the loop will not stop.
Doc: evaluates the sequence \kbd{expr2} (dependent on $p$ and $j$) for $p$
 prime between $a$ and $b$, in random order, computed in parallel. Substitute
 for $j$ the value of \kbd{expr1} (dependent on $p$).
 If $b$ is omitted, the loop will not stop.

 It is allowed fo \kbd{expr2} to exit the loop using
 \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return}, however in that case, \kbd{expr2} will
 still be evaluated for all remaining value of $p$ less than the current one,
 unless a subsequent \kbd{break}/\kbd{next}/\kbd{return} happens.
