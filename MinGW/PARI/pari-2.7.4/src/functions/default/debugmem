Doc: memory debugging level. If it is non-zero, \kbd{gp} will regularly print
 information on memory usage. If it's greater than 2, it will indicate any
 important garbage collecting and the function it is taking place in
 (see~\b{gm}).

 \noindent {\bf Important Note:} As it noticeably slows down the performance,
 the first functionality (memory usage) is disabled if you're not running a
 version compiled for debugging (see Appendix~A).

 The default value is \kbd{0} (no debugging messages).
