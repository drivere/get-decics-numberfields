Function: psdraw
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: postdraw_flag
Prototype: vGD0,L,
Help: psdraw(list, {flag=0}): same as plotdraw, except that the output is a
 PostScript program in psfile (pari.ps by default), and flag!=0 scales the
 plot from size of the current output device to the standard PostScript
 plotting size.
Doc: same as \kbd{plotdraw}, except that the output is a PostScript program
 appended to the \kbd{psfile}, and flag!=0 scales the plot from size of the
 current output device to the standard PostScript plotting size
