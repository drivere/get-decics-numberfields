Modular polynomials for PARI/GP
===============================

This package contains modular polynomials for p < 500, for use with ellsea.

These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA databases
available at <http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/>
and computed by David R. Kohel (kohel@maths.usyd.edu.au) University of Sydney
