C-Name: vecteur
Prototype: GDVDE
Help: vector(n,{X},{expr=0}): row vector with n components of expression
 expr (X ranges from 1 to n). By default, fill with 0s.
Doc: creates a row vector (type
 \typ{VEC}) with $n$ components whose components are the expression
 \var{expr} evaluated at the integer points between 1 and $n$. If one of the
 last two arguments is omitted, fill the vector with zeroes.

 Avoid modifying $X$ within \var{expr}; if you do, the formal variable
 still runs from $1$ to $n$. In particular, \kbd{vector(n,i,expr)} is not
 equivalent to
 \bprog
 v = vector(n)
 for (i = 1, n, v[i] = expr)
 @eprog\noindent
 as the following example shows:
 \bprog
 n = 3
 v = vector(n); vector(n, i, i++)            ----> [2, 3, 4]
 v = vector(n); for (i = 1, n, v[i] = i++)   ----> [2, 0, 4]
 @eprog\noindent
