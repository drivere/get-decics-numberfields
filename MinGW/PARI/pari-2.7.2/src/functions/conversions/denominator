 denominator of $x$. The meaning of this
 is clear when $x$ is a rational number or function. If $x$ is an integer
 or a polynomial, it is treated as a rational number or function,
 respectively, and the result is equal to $1$. For polynomials, you
 probably want to use
 \bprog
 denominator( content(x) )
 @eprog\noindent
 instead. As for modular objects, \typ{INTMOD} and \typ{PADIC} have
 denominator $1$, and the denominator of a \typ{POLMOD} is the denominator
 of its (minimal degree) polynomial representative.

 If $x$ is a recursive structure, for instance a vector or matrix, the lcm
 of the denominators of its components (a common denominator) is computed.
 This also applies for \typ{COMPLEX}s and \typ{QUAD}s.

 \misctitle{Warning} Multivariate objects are created according to variable
 priorities, with possibly surprising side effects ($x/y$ is a polynomial, but
 $y/x$ is a rational function). See \secref{se:priority}.
