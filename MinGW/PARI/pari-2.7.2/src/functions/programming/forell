Function: forell
Section: programming/control
C-Name: forell0
Prototype: vVLLI
Help: forell(E,a,b,seq): execute seq for each elliptic curves E of conductor
 between a and b in the elldata database.
Wrapper: (,,,vG)
Description:
 (,small,small,closure):void  forell(${4 cookie}, ${4 wrapper}, $2, $3)
Doc: evaluates \var{seq}, where the formal variable $E = [\var{name}, M, G]$
 ranges through all elliptic curves of conductors from $a$ to $b$. In this
 notation \var{name} is the curve name in Cremona's elliptic  curve  database,
 $M$ is the minimal model, $G$ is a $\Z$-basis of the free part of the
 Mordell-Weil group $E(\Q)$.
 \bprog
 ? forell(E, 1, 500, my([name,M,G] = E); \
     if (#G > 1, print(name)))

 The \tet{elldata} database must be installed and contain data for the
 specified conductors.
