Function: intfouriersin
Section: sums
C-Name: intfoursin0
Prototype: V=GGGEDGp
Help: intfouriersin(X=a,b,z,expr,{tab}): numerical integration from a to b
 of sin(2*Pi*z*X)*expr(X) from a to b, where a, b, and tab are as in intnum.
 This is the sine-Fourier transform if a=-infty and b=+infty.

Doc: numerical
 integration of $\var{expr}(X)\sin(2\pi zX)$ from $a$ to $b$, in other words
 Fourier sine transform (from $a$ to $b$) of the function represented by
 \var{expr}. Endpoints $a$ and $b$ are coded as in \kbd{intnum}, and are not
 necessarily at infinity but if they are, oscillations (i.e. $[[\pm1],\alpha
 I]$) are forbidden.
