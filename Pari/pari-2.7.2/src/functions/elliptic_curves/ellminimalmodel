Help: ellminimalmodel(E,{&v}): return the standard minimal integral model of
 the rational elliptic curve E. Sets v to the corresponding change of
 variables.
Doc: return the standard minimal integral model of the rational elliptic
 curve $E$. If present, sets $v$ to the corresponding change of variables,
 which is a vector $[u,r,s,t]$ with rational components. The return value is
 identical to that of \kbd{ellchangecurve(E, v)}.

 The resulting model has integral coefficients, is everywhere minimal, $a_1$
 is 0 or 1, $a_2$ is 0, 1 or $-1$ and $a_3$ is 0 or 1. Such a model is
 unique, and the vector $v$ is unique if we specify that $u$ is positive,
 which we do. \sidx{minimal model}
