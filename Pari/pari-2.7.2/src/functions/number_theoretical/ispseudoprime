Function: ispseudoprime
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: gispseudoprime
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: ispseudoprime(x,{flag}): true(1) if x is a strong pseudoprime, false(0)
 if not. If flag is 0 or omitted, use BPSW test, otherwise use strong
 Rabin-Miller test for flag randomly chosen bases.
Description:
 (int,?0):bool      BPSW_psp($1)
 (int,#small):bool  millerrabin($1,$2)
 (int,small):bool   ispseudoprime($1, $2)
 (gen,?small):bool  gispseudoprime($1, $2)
Doc: true (1) if $x$ is a strong pseudo
 prime (see below), false (0) otherwise. If this function returns false, $x$
 is not prime; if, on the other hand it returns true, it is only highly likely
 that $x$ is a prime number. Use \tet{isprime} (which is of course much
 slower) to prove that $x$ is indeed prime.
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.

 If $\fl = 0$, checks whether $x$ is a Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge-Wagstaff
 pseudo prime (strong Rabin-Miller pseudo prime for base $2$, followed by
 strong Lucas test for the sequence $(P,-1)$, $P$ smallest positive integer
 such that $P^2 - 4$ is not a square mod $x$).

 There are no known composite numbers passing this test, although it is
 expected that infinitely many such numbers exist. In particular, all
 composites $\leq 2^{64}$ are correctly detected (checked using
 \kbd{http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/index-2-to-64.html}).

 If $\fl > 0$, checks whether $x$ is a strong Miller-Rabin pseudo prime  for
 $\fl$ randomly chosen bases (with end-matching to catch square roots of $-1$).
