Help: rnfpseudobasis(nf,pol): given a pol with coefficients in nf, gives a
 4-component vector [A,I,D,d] where [A,I] is a pseudo basis of the maximal
 order in HNF on the power basis, D is the relative ideal discriminant, and d
 is the relative discriminant in nf^*/nf*^2.
Doc: given a number field
 $\var{nf}$ as output by \kbd{nfinit} and a polynomial \var{pol} with
 coefficients in $\var{nf}$ defining a relative extension $L$ of $\var{nf}$,
 computes a pseudo-basis $(A,I)$ for the maximal order $\Z_L$ viewed as a
 $\Z_K$-module, and the relative discriminant of $L$. This is output as a
 four-element row vector $[A,I,D,d]$, where $D$ is the relative ideal
 discriminant and $d$ is the relative discriminant considered as an element of
 $\var{nf}^*/{\var{nf}^*}^2$.
