A database of Galois polynomials (v 2.0)
================================

This packages contains a database of polynomials defining Galois extensions of
the rationals representing all abstract groups of order up to 127 for
all signatures (2429 polynomials).

Abstract groups are indexed according to the GAP 4 small groups database
<http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sgl.html>.
GAP4(a,b) denotes the group returned by SmallGroup(a,b) under GAP 4.

a/nb: the number of abstract groups of order a

a/b/real: Vector [pol,den] where pol is a totally real Galois polynomial
of Galois Group isomorphic to GAP4(a,b), and den is the common denominator
of the conjugates returned by nfgaloisconj.

a/b/complex: (a even) Vector [pol,den] where pol is a totally complex.
Galois polynomial of Galois Group isomorphic to GAP4(a,b), and den is the
common denominator of the conjugates returned by nfgaloisconj.

a/b/non-wss: if present, then the group GAP4(a,b) is not weakly super-solvable,
see ??galoisinit.
